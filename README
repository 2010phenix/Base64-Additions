The Base64 additions consits of two parts
	
	1.	The Base64 encoder and decoder, written in plain 
		C99 (ITBase64.h, ITBase64.c).
		
	2.	The NSData additions written in Objective-C, that uses functions 
		from part 1 (ITBase64Additions.h, ITBase64Additions.m).
	

Usage:

	If you only need the C99 encoder/decoder, include ITBase64.h in your 
	source code and add ITBase64.h and ITBase64.c to your project.
	A sample can be found in main.c
	
	To use the NSData additions, import ITBase64Additions.h in you source code
	and add ITBase64Addition.h, ITBase64Addition.c, ITBase64.h and ITBase64.c
	to your project.
